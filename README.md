# Programming 04 Java Examples

A repository of example code for the Programming 04 module. Each subfolder corresponds to a topic/week of the module.

## Running the Examples

The root of the classpath for each example is the root folder of that example, not the root folder of the repository. For example, to compile and run the `1-introduction-to-java/lecture/1-boilerplate/Boilerplate.java` example, execute `javac` and `java` from that directory:

```bash
cd 1-introduction-to-java/lecture/1-boilerplate/
javac Boilerplate.java
java Boilerplate
```
